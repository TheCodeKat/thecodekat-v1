I always dream about building my own portfolio/digital garden, but I never really got down to *actually* developing it because I was afraid it wouldn't turn it the way I would like it to. Well, I've decided to stop holding on to perfection and go for it: this is me building a personal site -aka my dream project- *while* I learn how to do it.
